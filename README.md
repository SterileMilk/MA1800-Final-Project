My website is a small collection of videos that resonated with me. I divided it into two moods: hopeful and dystopian. I wanted the site to remain simple, with just two pages where visitors can view the clips and experience the contrast between them.

For the hopeful page, I chose deer images as the thumbnails. This choice is personal because, as a child, my mum often took me to Richmond Park. Whenever we saw deer, I felt calm and believed that good things were on the way. This is why I associate deer with hope.

The dystopian page features thumbnails that align more with a techno-dystopia feel. All of the images I used came from Pinterest.

Inspiration

A major inspiration for the dystopian side of my website was the Instagram creator HighEnquires (John Rising). His montages are intense and encourage you to think differently about the world. Much of his content is anti-capitalist, but I selected videos that matched the theme of “technology feels overwhelming,” which I was aiming for.

For the hopeful page, I gathered clips from the Instagram account ge0tic, known for calming and positive videos.

In class, we discussed net.art and how the internet can function as an art medium rather than just a standard website. This made me realize that it was fine for the site to be simple and mood-focused instead of telling a specific story.

Challenges

This is my first experience with coding, so I found many things confusing at first. Positioning elements on the homepage, like the two links, took me some time. Also, adjusting the background images to show the parts I wanted was frustrating since they kept cropping oddly. I struggled to arrange the videos neatly on the page without disrupting the layout.

If I Had More Time

If I had more time, I would likely add additional moods or pages, perhaps themes like “nostalgia” or “chaos.” I would also work on the layout to give it a more artistic appearance. If I had the knowledge, I might even include sound or different interactions.
